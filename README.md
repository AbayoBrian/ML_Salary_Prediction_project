# Salary Prediction Model

This project aims to predict salaries based on various factors such as age, gender, education level, job title, and years of experience. The model is built using machine learning techniques and deployed using Flask.

## Files Included

- **app.py**: This file contains the Flask web application used for serving predictions.
- **model.py**: This Python script is responsible for training the machine learning model.
- **model.pkl**: This is the trained machine learning model saved in a binary format.
- **Salary Data.csv**: Dataset containing information about individuals' age, gender, education level, job title, years of experience, and salary.
- **Templates/index.html**: HTML template for the web interface where users can input their information for salary prediction.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required Python packages:

3. Run the Flask application:

4. Access the web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

5. Enter the required information (age, gender, education level, job title, years of experience) and click "Predict" to get the salary prediction.

## Development

If you want to modify or extend the project:
- You can explore different machine learning algorithms or improve the existing one in `model.py`.
- Enhance the web interface by modifying the HTML template in `Templates/index.html`.
- Add more features or improve the user experience in `app.py`.
